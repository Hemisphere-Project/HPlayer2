BUG
- check if RPi overlay is broken ?
- Looper Profile doesn't gracefully exit..

NEXT

- Move Scene / Media play in player logic
- Service Bonjour/ZeroConf/Zyre
- KEYPAD: Multiple page -> manual mode !
- WebCTRL: Control multiple Pi with matrix view
- Clean up log in player and overlays like in interfaces
- Clean up overlay like interfaces

FUTURE
- Replacing custom trigger / event player system with pyee or equivalent.
Check if '*' is supported.
- command line arguments alongside profiles for direct start

LONG SHOT
- doc for each interfaces
- add a global manageable extension filter
- replacing log system with a global and configurable one..
- ofxomxplayer backend // libvlc backend
- media preroll for better sync accuracy
